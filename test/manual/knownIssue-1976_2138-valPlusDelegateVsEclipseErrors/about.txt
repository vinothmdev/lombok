PullRequest https://github.com/rzwitserloot/lombok/pull/2114 tries to fix issue https://github.com/rzwitserloot/lombok/issues/1976 but causes problems.

The problem is that the fail-fast resolver applied by PR 2114 causes the following issue:

Given:

A.java:

	public class A {
		interface Inner {
			default void example() {
				lombok.val v = doesNotExist();
			}
		}
	B b = new B();
	}

B.java:

	import com.foo.pkg.A.Inner;

	public class B implements Inner {
		void foo() {
			lombok.val v = doesNotExist();
		}
	}

will cause A.java to be parsed such that nothing in it exists, in turn causing B to consider A.Inner to not exist at all,
even though the error on the 'implements Inner' line offers 'import Inner' as a quickfix. This quickfix won't, obviously, fix it.

In addition, enough 'A refers to B refers to A' loops with errors like this and eclipse 2019-06 will eventually run out of heap and crash.

The key commit that attempts to fix 1976 but causes the above issue is commit 089f2ec5f45567c8c12e9d13bf9be8fa5c107c18.

The commit that undoes this, re-introducing 1976 but avoiding the problem above, is commit 877a169727a4c8078c43a4465929247c3390c897.
